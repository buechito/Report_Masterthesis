\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I would like to express my thanks to my supervisor Nico Zimmermann for the good collaboration, work and support. Furthermore I would like to thank the Institute for Machine Tools and Manufacturing (IWF), under the direction of Professor Konrad Wegener.  And a further thank you goes to Inspire AG, which provided the infrastructure needed.
