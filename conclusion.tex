\section{Future Work}

To make the learning process more efficient, it would be an interesting option to simulate the deformations of the machine. Using the finite element method, artificial load cases could be simulated. This requires a model of the machine tool, which is available, as well as the positions of the sensors. With this, the deformations on the TCP can be calculated simulatively, which would make the teach-in on the machine tool superfluous.

The large effort of teaching on the machine tool, which requires a relatively large amount of resources, could thus be bypassed and would only need to be applied for validation purposes.
