\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chp:stateoftheart}

This chapter gives an overview of the methods currently used. First of all, the topic of thermal errors is introduced, which form the basis for this thesis. In the next step the TALC method is introduced, that is also used in this thesis. Further the adaptive input selection is described. Finally, the disadvantages of the previous methods and it illustrates why alternatives are needed.
